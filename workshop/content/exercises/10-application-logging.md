Each instance of an application runs in it's own `pod`.

As you have already seen, you can list the `pods` for the front end web application using:

```execute
kubectl get pods -l app=blog -o name
```

To access the log output for a specific instance of your application, you can use the name of the `pod` with the `kubectl logs` command.

As we have multiple pods, we need to grab just one of the names.

{% raw %}
```execute
POD=`kubectl get pod -l app=blog -o template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | head -1` && echo $POD
```
{% endraw %}

Then run `kubectl logs`:

```execute
kubectl logs $POD
```

Rather than identify a specific pod, you can also run `kubectl logs` against the deployment using:

```execute
kubectl logs deployment/blog
```

Where there are multiple pods, this will result in one of the pods associated with the deployment being randomly selected. So you will need to select the pod if you need to be sure about which one the logs are being retrieved from.

If there are multiple containers in the `pod`, you would need to name the container using the `-c` or `--container` option. Alternatively, you could use the `--all-containers` option to fetch logs from application process running in any of the containers.

If you wanted to follow the output of the running application, you can use the `-f` or `--follow` option.

When you have multiple replicas of your application, you would need to fetch the application logs from each `pod`. A Kubernetes cluster may optionally have a service deployed for aggregated logging, in which case you could access that service to view logs for all instances of the application at the same time.
